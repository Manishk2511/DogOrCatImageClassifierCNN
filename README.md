# ImageClassifierCNN (code is given give comments to understand each step properly)

This project uses convolutional neural network to predict whether the image is of dog or cat.

After training it upto 25 epochs only it is giving accuracy greater than 89% on training set and 80% percent on test set

you can add more nodes or increase number of epochs to get better results.

you can also make changes in data preprocessing to decrease chances of overfitting.
